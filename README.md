# Python Advanced Calculator

## how to use:

download the git repo, and run the calculator.py file. everything should work fine.
you will need the following python libraries

    -decimal
    -pygame
    -time

## capabilites

this calculator can handle complex combinations of parentheses.

it can handle complex numbers with basic operators, but not with any more complex function

here is a list of all the operations it can perform:

    -addition
    -substraction
    -multiplication
    -division
    -exponentiation
    -square root
    -nth root
    -nth logarithm
    -Poly logarithm (doesnt really work)
    -natural logarithm
    -factorial (also works with decimal points)
    -all trigonometric functions
    -all inverse trigonometric functions
    -all hyperbolic trigonometric functions
    -all inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functrions
    -definite integral (not very precise)
    -indefinite integral (does not work)
    -summation (not very precise)
    -product (not very precise)

you can type all numbers with the keyboard, you can use backspace to delete the last element, and shift + backspace to clear everything.

you can also input basic operators with the keyboard.

since not every function fits on the screen, you can scroll down using by holding down the mouse and moving it.

## note

the code for this calculator is not very readable. i have made a similar version in c++ which is a lot faster, and has way better code
